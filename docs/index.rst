Welcome! This is the place where Superdesk technical documentation lives. You will learn
here mainly about the Superdesk server application. A good starting point is the
:ref:`installation`. It might also be a good idea to check out the :ref:`overview` before digging
deeper into the system :ref:`reference`.

For technical documentation on the Superdesk client web application, please have a look
`here <https://github.com/superdesk/superdesk-client-core>`_.
